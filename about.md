### Who Am I?

Hi, my name is Jason Edwards and welcome to my blog. I am a 30 something Senior Platform Engineer from the UK. Specialising in Jenkins, Python, AWS, Terraform and Kubernetes. Amongst my many hobbies I fancy myself an amateur writer who has a profound passion for technology and software of all kinds. I am constantly tweaking and building things especially if something I want doesnâ€™t already exist.

### Why did I create this blog?
This blog was created to share my thoughts with the world, it addresses many different aspects of life but primarily IT Support, technology, software development, writing and various subcategories including Linux System Administration and programming.

### My Interests
I enjoy reading technical sites and other blogs on a daily basis. This blog is my way of sharing my knowledge back to the industry that made me who I am today.
